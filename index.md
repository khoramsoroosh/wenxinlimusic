# About Me

Wenxin Li is a Lecturer of Composition & Technology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee where she teaches Composition, Aural Theory, Orchestration, and Computer Music.

A US-based composer originally from Chongqing, China, Li draws inspiration from the natural world and sounds, emotional experiences, scientific concepts, transcultural ideas and the rich landscape of Chinese literature and music. She views the act of creating music as akin to constructing multi-dimensional architectures, where she explores the connections between time and space, visuals and sonics, acoustics and electronics, and examines the logic within these relationships.

Liâ€™s music spans a wide spectrum of solo and large ensemble, vocal and instrumental, acoustic and electronic. Her compositions have earned recognition and been featured at prestigious events and festivals such as the Aspen Music Festival, Composers Conference, SCI National Conference, SPLICE Festival, RED NOTE New Music Festival, FSU New Music Festival, Electronic Music Midwest, Asian Classical Music Initiative, and Midwest Composers Symposium. Her works have been performed by renowned ensembles including the JACK Quartet, Ensemble Dal Niente, H2 Quartet, and Accroche Note, and have won awards such as First Place in ClefWorks Composition Competition, Alex Shapiro Prize in IAWM Search for New Music Competition, Mullen Sacred Music Composition Prize, First Place in Chengdu Jiezi Saxophone Composition Contest, and Second Place in GTA (Qinling) International Guitar Festival Composition Competition.

Li is currently a PhD candidate in composition at the University of Iowa, where she has been honored with the Marcus Bach Fellowship. She holds a Master of Music in composition from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a Bachelor of Arts in composition and theory from Sichuan Conservatory of Music, China.
