      This piece is inspired by the wave movement of water ripples. Water waves are a mixture of longitudinal and transverse waves. They have various shapes, directions and dimensions. In this piece, I try to present an auditory illustration of three wave movements and effects, from formation until it fades. In the first section, the wave forms, at a single point, and starts to disperse and expand to the surrounding area. In the second section, we can see the vertical movements the wave causes in the water, rising from a low point gradually to a high point and then cycling back. In the final section, after a long time propagating, the energy of water ripples decreases and we can barely see the wave, but it is still going and moving towards a further place.
