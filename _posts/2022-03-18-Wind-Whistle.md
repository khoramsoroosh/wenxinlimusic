Wind Whistle focuses on the conflict and intertwinement between two characters: one is active, fast and restless, while the other is long, sustained and drowning. Both ideas are presented in the very beginning of the piece, and developed throughout in various formats, including multiphonics, slap tonguing, timbre trill, etc. The sound effects of the piece remind me of winter wind whistling through the window.
