- Duration: 6 minutes
- Written for and premiered by Ensemble Dal Niente
- Program note: When the Moon Came Up is an ensemble piece built around two contrasting themes. One is fragmented and cluttered, while the other is lyrical and melodic. These themes constantly evolve, contrasting and intertwining throughout the piece. The lyrics are composed of fragmented syllables, words, and phrases from the Chinese folk song 小河淌水 (Xiao He Tang Shui). The title, When the Moon Came Up, is drawn from the song’s opening phrase, “yue liang chu lai,” which means “the moon comes up.”
