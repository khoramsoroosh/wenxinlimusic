    Program note: 
    <div class="program-notes">
      Wu is a live electronics piece working with motion detection in Max/MSP. It tracks the performer’s body movements with a camera and translates those movements to control commands for playing and mixing pre-recorded sounds. Wu (舞) in Chinese means dance. Normally dance comes after music. However, in this piece, dance creates the music.
