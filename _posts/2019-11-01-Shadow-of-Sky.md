    Program note: 
    <div class="program-notes">
      <p>Shadow of Sky is inspired by the ancient Chinese song Sky-shading Apricot Blossoms (杏花天影), composed by Jiang Kui in 1187 AD. The piece is built on the first four notes of the original melody, which form a quasi-symmetrical structure. This symmetry serves as a foundation for the piece and recurs throughout its pitch content, rhythmic patterns, and overall form.</p>
      <p>The tuba, used here as both a melodic and textural voice, employs extended techniques such as exhaling, singing, whispering, and whistling through the instrument to evoke the fragility and depth of an ancient song. These acoustic gestures are captured and transformed in real time through a custom Max/MSP patch, which processes the live input using effects such as granulation, delay, reverb, spatialization, and harmonic layering.</p>
      <p>Triggering and modulation of the effects are controlled via keyboard input, allowing the performer to interact with and shape the electronics throughout the piece. This integration of live processing and acoustic expression creates a fluid, immersive sound world where tradition and technology intertwine.</p>
