This piece is inspired by an ancient Chinese song “Sky-Shading Apricot Blossoms” (杏花天影) composed by Jiang Kui in 1187. I used the first four notes of this song, which are formed in a quasi-symmetrical structure, as the foundation and motive in my piece. This quasi-symmetry can be found in its pitches, rhythm, and structure. This piece also used some extended techniques on tuba, including exhaling, singing, whispering, and whistling through the instrument, to create an ancient song feeling. This piece was composed for David E. Mercedes.
