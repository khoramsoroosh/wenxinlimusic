- Duration: 4 minutes 30 seconds
- Originally for soprano and piano; adapted for and premiered by Anne Amen.
- Program note: 
I live my life in growing circles
which ring out over the things around me.
Perhaps I'll never finish the last,
but that's what I'm going to try.

I'm circling around God, around the ancient tower,
and I've been circling for thousands of years;
and I still don't know: am I a falcon, a storm
or a great song.
