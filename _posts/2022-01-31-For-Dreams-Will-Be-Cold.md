My then fiancé (now husband) and I had been in a long-distance relationship for nearly two years. The most difficult moments were not when we are apart, but when I had to watch them drive away after visits. The shortlived happiness of yesterday fresh in my mind, doubled the aching of the long and lonely anticipation of the coming days. In these times, I was reminded of the Chinese poem by Li Shutong saying “dreams will be cold after tonight’s farewell (今宵别梦寒).”
