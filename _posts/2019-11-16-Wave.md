This piece is inspired by the wave movement of water ripples. Water waves are a mixture of longitudinal and transverse waves, and they have various shapes, directions, and dimensions. In this piece, I try to present an auditory illustration of three-wave movement and its effects, from formation to the point until it fades from view. In the first section, the wave forms at a single point, and starts to disperse and expand to the surrounding area. In the second section, vertical movements of the wave cause the water to rise gradually from a low point to a high point, then cycle back. In the final section, after a long time propagating, the energy of the water ripples decreases, and we can barely see the wave but know that it is still going and moving toward another place, another dimension.
